The reference for the current project is taken from Skill Lync.
The objectives of the project include:
- Simulation of p-V diagram of diesel cycle
- Obtaining thermal efficiency, net work output, and mean effective pressure developed by the engine
- Understanding the variation trend of efficiency with compression ratio, cut-off ratio, and stroke length

Thermodynamic processes involved:
- Reversible Adiabatic Process (Isentropic Compression and Expansion)
- Constant Pressure Process (Isobaric Heat Addition)
- Constant Volume Process (Isochoric Heat Rejection)
